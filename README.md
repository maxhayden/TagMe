## DEMO

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/786618ba-b1ee-4cec-a370-87de97bb95ef

---

## Features

- Upload and tag images using AI (AWS Rekognition)
- Search photos by tags
- User authentication with secure sessions
- Responsive and minimal UI (mobile & desktop)
- Real-time image processing pipeline
- Handles up to 10 concurrent users

---

## Architecture

1. **User uploads photo via EC2-hosted frontend**
2. **Image is stored in S3**
3. **S3 triggers a message to SQS**
4. **SQS invokes a Lambda function**
5. **Lambda processes the image with Rekognition**
6. **Results (tags) are saved to RDS**
7. **Frontend queries RDS to display tagged photos**

### Cloud Setup
- All resources are contained in a VPC 
- EC2 instance in public subnet 
- Lambda + RDS in private subnet
- NAT Gateway enables private subnet access to S3/Rekognition

- **Deployment:** AWS CloudFormation (YAML IaC)
- **Scripting:** Bash + Curl for EC2 provisioning

---

## Deployment

This application uses **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with AWS CloudFormation for fully automated provisioning of all services and dependencies. Launching the stack builds the full cloud architecture in a single click.

---

## Security

- VPC with isolated public/private subnets
- EC2 security groups restrict access to ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH)
- RDS access limited to port 3306 within VPC
- S3 access restricted to authenticated users
- Session data securely stored in RDS
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- MySQL prepared statements protect against SQL injection
- Secrets stored in environment variables

**Note:** For educational/development purposes only. Future versions will include Cognito, HTTPS, encryption at rest, and IAM roles for finer-grained access control.

## Cost Evaluation

### Estimated Monthly Cost (Post-Free Tier):

| Resource       | Cost Estimate     |
|----------------|------------------|
| EC2 (t2.micro) | ~$8.47           |
| Elastic IP     | ~$3.65           |
| NAT Gateway    | ~$32.85          |
| **Total**      | **~$45/month**   |

### Notes:
- Free Tier covers 12 months of EC2, RDS, and basic S3 usage
- SQS is free for the first 1M requests/month
- S3 charges ~$0.023/GB after 5GB free
- NAT data transfer charges apply ($0.045/GB)

Cost can be reduced using S3 archival tiers, Aurora Serverless, or private VPC endpoints.
